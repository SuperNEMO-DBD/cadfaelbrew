# Cadfaelbrew (Legacy)
This repository has been deprecated and split into two repositories:
- [SuperNEMO-DBD/brew](https://github.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/brew): the Linuxbrew
  package manager without any formulae/packages (i.e. without the former contents of `Library/Formula`)
- [Linuxbrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-core): the upstream formulae/packages (i.e. the former contents of `Library/Formula`) for the Linuxbrew package manager

Please note: you don't need to move pull requests or issues over from this. We will handle all migrations.
